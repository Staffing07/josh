# Installation


We assume you are doing a fresh installation.

Incase you are using Josh in an existing laravel project, please follow guide and avoid steps which you have implemented already.

#### Install Laravel
Josh doesn't ship with whole laravel file, so you need to intall laravel yourself.

You can use any of methods mentioned in [laravel website](http://laravel.com/docs/4.2/installation)

our preferred method is to install using composer by executing ```composer create-project laravel/laravel your_project_name

#### Upgrading from Laravel 4

Since laravel has changed a lot in laravel 5, we are not providing any direct way of upgrading to laravel 5 from 4.
