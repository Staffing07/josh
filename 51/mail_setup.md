# Mail

Laravel 5.1 stored all mail information in <code>.env</code> so setup details in <code>.env</code>

Still you need to set **sender name and email** details in
```config/mail.php
```

If you are testing locally or don't want to send any mails, then please set <code>'pretend' => true,</code> in <code>config/mail.php</code> at bottom of the page.
