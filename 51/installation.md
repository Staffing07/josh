# Installation

We assume you are doing a fresh installation.

Incase you are using Josh in an existing laravel project, please follow guide and avoid steps which you have implemented already.

#### Install Laravel

Josh doesn't ship with whole laravel files, so you need to intsall laravel yourself.

You can use any of methods mentioned in [laravel website](http://laravel.com/docs/5.1/installation)

our preferred method is to install using composer by executing `composer create-project laravel/laravel:5.1 your_project_name`

If you are using phpstorm, then follow this [tutorial](http://laraveldaily.com/phpstorm-easily-create-new-laravel-project/) to install it easily.

#### Upgrading from Laravel 5

Please follow [official guidelines](http://laravel.com/docs/5.1/upgrade#upgrade-5.1.0)

#### Upgrading from Laravel 4

Since laravel has changed a lot in laravel 5, we are not providing any direct way of upgrading to laravel 5 from 4.

If you really want to do that, please follow [official guidelines](http://laravel.com/docs/5.1/upgrade) or follow [Matt Stauffer's](http://mattstauffer.co/blog/upgrading-from-laravel-4-to-laravel-5) guide.
