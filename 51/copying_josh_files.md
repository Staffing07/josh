# Copying Josh files

now copy files from downloaded folder to your laravel 5.1 installation.

#### Copying to existing project
If you are planning to use JOSH into your existing Laravel project, then please copy required code from ```
app/Http/routes.php```
 into your routes.php to avoid any un-necessary problems.

Check all other files yourself and copy only required files.
