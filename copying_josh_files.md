# Copying Josh files
Copy files from downloaded folder to your laravel5 installation.

#### Copying to existing project
If you are planning to use JOSH into your existing Laravel project, then please copy required code from ```
app/routes.php```
 into your routes.php to avoid any un-necessary problems.

Check all other files yourself and copy only required files.
