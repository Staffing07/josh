# Copying Josh files

**If you are using 5.1 please ignore this step.**

Laravel 5 ships with a basic auth so it includes many files like views, controllers etc.

Since we don't need any of them, please execute following command to remove them.

```
php artisan fresh
```


now copy files from downloaded folder to your laravel5 installation.

#### Copying to existing project
If you are planning to use JOSH into your existing Laravel project, then please copy required code from ```
app/Http/routes.php```
 into your routes.php to avoid any un-necessary problems.

Check all other files yourself and copy only required files.
