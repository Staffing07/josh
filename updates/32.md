### Updating

Blog module uses two composer packages so we need to install them

** add packages to composer **

open your composer and add following packages
````
    "cviebrock/eloquent-sluggable": "dev-master",
    "cviebrock/eloquent-taggable": "dev-master"
````

then in your terminal hit <code>composer update</code>


** publish vendor files **

in terminal hit <code>php artisan vendor:publish</code>

** migrate tables **

in terminal hit 
````
php artisan sluggable:table blogs

php artisan taggable:table

php artisan migrate

````

** service providers **

open <code>config/app.php</code> and add following lines in <code>providers</code> array

````
Cviebrock\EloquentSluggable\SluggableServiceProvider::class,
Cviebrock\EloquentTaggable\ServiceProvider::class,
````

** upload directory permissions **

blog pics will be uploaded into <code>public/uploads/blog</code>

so we need to provide write access for that folder

to do so, please run following command in your command prompt/terminal
````
chmod 777 public/uploads/blog
````
