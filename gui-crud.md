# GUI Builder

Josh comes with GUI based CRUD builder, using which you can generated new CRUD files with just some clicks.

## folder Permissions

Give write permissions to models, controllers, views, routes and migrations

```
chmod  775 resources/views/admin 

chmod  775 app/Models    

chmod  775 app/Http/Controllers

chmod 775 app/Http/Requests 

chmod  775 database/migrations

chmod  775 app/Repositories

chmod 666 routes/web_builder.php

chmod 666 resources/views/admin/layouts/menu.blade.php
```

**Note: **if you get any permission issues change permissions `chmod 775`  to `chmod 777`
