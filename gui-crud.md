# GUI Builder

Josh comes with GUI based CRUD builder, using which you can generated new CRUD files with just some clicks.

## folder Permissions

Give write permissions to models, controllers, views, routes and migrations

```\`php
chmod  775 routes

chmod  775 resources/views    

chmod  775 app/Models/    

chmod  775 app/Http    

chmod  775 database/migrations

chmod  775 app/Repositories
```

**Note: **if you get any permission issues change permissions chmod -R 775  to chmod -R 777
